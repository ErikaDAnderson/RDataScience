## 28.2.1 Label Exercises

1.Create one plot on the fuel economy data with customised title, subtitle, caption, x, y, and colour labels.

2.The geom_smooth() is somewhat misleading because the hwy for large engines is skewed upwards due to the inclusion of lightweight sports cars with big engines. Use your modelling tools to fit and display a better model.

3.Take an exploratory graphic that youâ€™ve created in the last month, and add informative titles to make it easier for others to understand.
