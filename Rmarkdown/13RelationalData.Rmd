A group of DFO coworkers decided to work together to compete the exercises in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. 

# 13.2.1 Exercises

1. Imagine you wanted to draw (approximately) the route each plane flies from its origin to its destination. What variables would you need? What tables would you need to combine?

To draw a flight route, you would need to link the flights and airports tables to get the flights.origin and flights.dest airport.lat and airport.longitude spatial information.

2. I forgot to draw the relationship between weather and airports. What is the relationship and how should it appear in the diagram?

The link between weather and airport would be through airports.faa to weather.origin.

3. weather only contains information for the origin (NYC) airports. If it contained weather records for all airports in the USA, what additional relation would it define with flights?

If weather contained more airports, then the flights.dest could link to the weather table too.

4. We know that some days of the year are “special”, and fewer people than usual fly on them. How might you represent that data as a data frame? What would be the primary keys of that table? How would it connect to the existing tables?

A SpecialDates table would require year, month, day, and name columns, and could be connected to flights via a composite key year-month-day or a date column.

# 13.3.1 Exercises

1. Add a surrogate key to flights.

```{r}

flights %>% 
  mutate(., newkey = row_number()) %>%
  select(newkey, everything())

# Jocelyn's method
flights$row_num2 <- seq.int(nrow(flights))

# another way
flights <- rowid_to_column(flights, "row_num3")

```


2. Identify the keys in the following datasets
(You might need to install some packages and read some documentation.)

```{r}

#Lahman::Batting
Lahman::Batting %>%
  count(playerID, yearID, stint) %>%
  filter(n > 1)

#babynames::babynames
babynames::babynames %>%
  count(year, sex, name) %>%
  filter(n > 1)

#nasaweather::atmos
nasaweather::atmos %>%
  count(lat, long, year, month) %>%
  filter(n > 1)

#fueleconomy::vehicles
fueleconomy::vehicles %>%
  count(id) %>%
  filter(n > 1)

# ggplot2::diamonds
ggplot2::diamonds %>%
  mutate(., newKey = row_number()) %>%
  select(newKey, everything())

```


3. Draw a diagram illustrating the connections between the Batting, Master, and Salaries tables in the Lahman package. 

```{r}

str(Lahman::Batting) # key is playerID, yearID, stint

# find primary keys
str(Lahman::Master)
Lahman::Master %>%
  count(playerID) %>%
  filter(n > 1)

str(Lahman::Salaries)
Lahman::Salaries %>%
  count(yearID, teamID, playerID) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
```

- Batting has a composite primary key of playerID, yearID, stint  
- Master.playerID is a primary key  
- Salaries has a composite primary key of yearID, teamID, playerID  

![Batting, Master, Salaries](figures/image13_4_3a.png)

Draw another diagram that shows the relationship between Master, Managers, AwardsManagers.

```{r}

str(Lahman::Master)
str(Lahman::Managers)
Lahman::Managers %>%
  count(playerID, yearID, inseason) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
str(Lahman::AwardsManagers)
Lahman::AwardsManagers %>%
  count(playerID, awardID, yearID) %>%
  filter(n > 1)

```

- Batting has a composite primary key of playerID, yearID, stint  
- Managers has a composite primary ket of playerID, yearID, inseason  
- AwardsManager has a composite primary key of playerID, awardID, yearID.  

![Master, Managers, AwardsManagers](figures/image13_4_3b.png)

How would you characterise the relationship between the Batting, Pitching, and Fielding tables?

The batting, pitching and fielding tables have stats on each player, for each year and stint. These tables have different statistics but are organized in the same fashion. They are related through the composite primary key playerID-yearID-stint.


# 13.4.6 Exercises

1. Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here’s an easy way to draw a map of the United States:

```{r}
airports %>%
  
  semi_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
    borders("state") +
    geom_point() +
    coord_quickmap()

```

(Don’t worry if you don’t understand what semi_join() does — you’ll learn about it next.)

You might want to use the size or colour of the points to display the average delay for each airport.

```{r}

# calculate average arrival delay for each airport
flights_delay <- flights %>%
  left_join(., airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  group_by(dest, lat, lon) %>%
  summarize(., avg_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(lat))

# display on map
ggplot(flights_delay, aes(lon, lat, color = avg_delay)) +
  geom_point() +
    borders("state") +
    geom_point() +
    coord_quickmap() +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  theme_bw()



```


2. Add the location of the origin and destination (i.e. the lat and lon) to flights.

```{r}

flights_loc <- flights %>%
  left_join(., airports, by = c("origin" = "faa")) %>%
  left_join(., airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"), suffix = c("_origin", "_dest"))

```


3. Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?

A weak correlation with age. It appears cyclic with planes older than 1980s consistent and 15 year old planes most delayed.

```{r}
flights_age <- flights %>%
  left_join(., planes, by = "tailnum",
            suffix = c("_flights", "_plane")) %>%
  group_by(year_plane) %>%
  summarize(meanDelay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(meanDelay))
  
  ggplot(flights_age) +
  geom_point(aes(year_plane, meanDelay)) +
    theme_bw()
  

```


4. What weather conditions make it more likely to see a delay?


```{r}

flights_weather <- flights %>%
  left_join(., weather, by = c("year", "month", "day", "origin", "hour", "time_hour")) %>%
  arrange(desc(dep_delay))

flights_weather %>%
  group_by(pressure) %>%
  summarize(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(pressure, delay)) +
  geom_point()

flights_weather %>%
  group_by(temp) %>%
  summarize(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(temp, delay)) +
  geom_point()

flights_weather %>%
  group_by(precip) %>%
  summarize(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(precip, delay)) +
  geom_point()

flights_weather %>%
  group_by(humid) %>%
  summarize(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(humid, delay)) +
  geom_point()


```

Noisy data to see trends in weather, but specific pressures are problematic and precipitation is positively correlated with delays.


5. What happened on June 13 2013? Display the spatial pattern of delays, and then use Google to cross-reference with the weather.

It looks like there were severe storms in the mid west. [National Weather Service Severe Weather Event](https://www.weather.gov/cle/2013_June12-13). Scroll down to see satellite map.

(Grouping by origin only gives New York airports so there is less informaiton.)

```{r}

flights_Jun132013 <- flights %>%
  filter(year == 2013, month == 6, day == 13) %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  left_join(., airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(lat))

# display on map
flights_Jun132013 %>%
ggplot(aes(lon, lat, color = delay)) +
    borders("state") +
    geom_point() +
    coord_quickmap() +
    scale_color_viridis() +
  theme_bw()

```

# 13.5.1 Exercises

1. What does it mean for a flight to have a missing tailnum? What do the tail numbers that don’t have a matching record in planes have in common? (Hint: one variable explains ~90% of the problems.)

Carriers AA and MQ do not include tail numbers.

```{r}

flights_misstail <- flights %>%
  anti_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
  count(tailnum, sort = TRUE)

# use semi join to find the original planes without tailnums
flights %>%
  semi_join(flights_misstail, by = "tailnum") %>%
  count(carrier) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

```


2. Filter flights to only show flights with planes that have flown at least 100 flights.

```{r}

flights100 <- flights %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  count(tailnum) %>%
  filter(n >= 100) 

 flights %>%
  semi_join(flights100, by = "tailnum")

```


3. Combine fueleconomy::vehicles and fueleconomy::common to find only the records for the most common models.

```{r}

fueleconomy::vehicles %>%
  semi_join(common, by = c("make", "model"))

```


4. Find the 48 hours (over the course of the whole year) that have the worst delays. Cross-reference it with the weather data. Can you see any patterns?

The worst day was July 23, 2013 and the best was December 1, 2013 so the temperature is lower on the best day. There was also some precip on the worst day. Generally, the worst delay day had higher humidity and wind speeds. This is just a comparison of the weather on the best and worst days and all conditions on all days should be included in a real study.

```{r}

# get the worst two days with the longest delays
twodays <- flights %>%
  group_by(month, day) %>%
  summarize(avg_delay = sum(arr_delay + dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(twoday_delay = avg_delay + lag(avg_delay)) %>%
  arrange(-twoday_delay) %>%
  ungroup() 

worst2days <- twodays %>%
  slice(1:1) 

best2days <- twodays %>%
  slice(365:365) 

twodays_select <- rbind(worst2days, best2days)

# limit to worst two days and join to weather by destination
twodays_select <- flights %>%
  semi_join(., twodays_select, by = c("month", "day")) %>%
  left_join(., weather, by = c("origin", "year", "month", "day")) %>%
  mutate(., condition = if_else(day == 23, "worst", "best")) %>%
  select(condition, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, precip, pressure, visib)

# graph
ggplot(twodays_select) +
  geom_point(aes(temp, precip, color = condition))

ggplot(twodays_select) +
  geom_point(aes(humid, wind_speed, color = condition))

```


5. What does anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) tell you? What does anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest")) tell you?

anti_join()
return all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, keeping just columns from x.  
  
So the columns from flights are returned (that do not have matches in airports) in the first anti-join and the columns from airports (that do not have matches in flights) are returned in the second anti-join.

```{r}

anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))

anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest"))

```


6. You might expect that there’s an implicit relationship between plane and airline, because each plane is flown by a single airline. Confirm or reject this hypothesis using the tools you’ve learned above.

Yes planes with the same tail number were flown by different carriers in this data set. Maybe they sold them?

```{r}

planes_multiple_carrier <- flights %>%
  distinct(carrier, tailnum) %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  count() %>%
  filter(n > 1)

flights %>%
  semi_join(., planes_multiple_carrier, by = "tailnum") %>%
  select(year, month, carrier, tailnum) %>%
  arrange(tailnum)
  

```
